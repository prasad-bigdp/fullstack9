How to link / apply styles to HTML?
 we can do it by three ways. There are 3 ways to include CSS to HTML.
   i. inline CSS
       inline CSS means styling will be applied in the same line of element by taking 'style' as a attribute
       <element style="properties">dfbmdbmdf
       </element>
   ii. internal CSS:
       internal CSS allows stylng to be applied in the same file but 'style' as a element. it is recommanded to use internal css at the end of head
        <style>
        p
        {
           background-color: red;
           color: blue;
        }
    </style>
   iii. external CSS: We can even apply same styling from an external file. the file should be saved as .css extension and will be linked to HTML using 'link' tag
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="path">
   Basic Selectors:
    we can identify HTML elements in CSS using three basic Selectors
     -- tag Selectors: it is used to select an element using tag
     -- class selector: it is used to to select sn element using classes. class is an attribute which can be represented by multiple elements
     To select an element using class, we need to keep prefix as dor
     -- id selector: it is used to select an element uniquely
     we use hash for id
     
     id>class>tag

     More Selectors:
    We can select elements based on their position and their parent containers like:
      i. direct-child(>): it selects elements which are direct child of another element
       element1>element2
      ii. descendant(' '): it selects elements which comes in any nested element of parent.
      element element
      iii. immediate after sibling(+): it selects elements which comes right after another element
      element1+element2
      iv. General sibling: it selects elements which comes after another element
      element1~element2

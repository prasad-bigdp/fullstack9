Display: Display is used to change the nature of elements. using this property we can control how to present our elements
display: inline -- converts element to inline element i.e., they allow next/previous elements beside them but inline will not allow height/width
display: block -- converts element to block element i.e., they won't allow previous/next element beside them but they allow height and width
display:inline-block -- converts elements to inline and block such that it allows height and width and also side by side
display:none -- it will not display the element and remove its space also
  -- alternative to remove element is visibility:hidden
